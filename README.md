# WanderingSpot 

Originally, the WanderingSpot has been a simple Java-application displaying map-images with spots wandering around on it. Basically, it can be used to set up experimental presentations consisting of "spot-maps" and static images (e.g. presentation slides). 

By now, it is intended that the application will evolve to a development-environment that allows to set up simple interactive projection solutions.

The application has been developed at the Geovisulization laboratory of Bochum University of Applied Sciences.

The application is open to anyone who is interested. You are very welcome to participate or to bring in innovative visualization ideas!
